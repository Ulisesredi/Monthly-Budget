# Monthly Budget

This app helps you to keep track of your monthly balance, by adding your incomes and expenses.

## Objective
The main objective of this project was to try a specific set of technologies. Integrating Next.js with persistent Redux states.

## The App
The App is pretty simple. It displays an input form to load your expenses and incomes, two lists where you can see your items previously loaded and your current subtotal.
